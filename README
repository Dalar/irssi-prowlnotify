prowlnotify Irssi Plugin
------------------------

prowlnotify is a simple script to send push notifications from Irssi to the
iPhone via Prowl (http://prowl.weks.net/).

It was originally based on BCOW's awayproxy.pl script which automatically marks
you as away when your last IRC client disconnects from Irssi's proxy. Given my
use of Irssi proxy, this was a perfect starting point.

Installation
------------

  1. Create a text file in ~/.prowlkey containing your Prowl API key.
  2. Copy the script into Irssi's scripts dir (typically ~/.irssi/scripts/)
  3. /script load prowlnotify.pl
