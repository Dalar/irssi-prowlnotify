prowlnotify Irssi Plugin
------------------------

prowlnotify is a simple script to send push notifications from Irssi to the
iPhone via Prowl (http://http://www.prowlapp.com).

It was originally based on BCOW's awayproxy.pl script which automatically marks
you as away when your last IRC client disconnects from Irssi's proxy. Given my
use of Irssi proxy, this was a perfect starting point.

Installation
------------

  1. Create a text file in ~/.prowlkey containing your Prowl API key.
  2. Copy the script into Irssi's scripts dir (typically ~/.irssi/scripts/)
  3. /script load prowlnotify.pl


screen_away
-----------
This version of the script depends on the screen_away boolean flag to see if
it should notify or not. it therefore depends on screen_away.pl
